### Task:

Create iOS/Android application which shows user's books lists.

Main app screen should show a list of user's books lists in a vertical scroll. Each list should show
up to 5 books in a horizontal scroll. Tapping button "ALL" should show a screen with all the books
of that list in a vertical scroll. Tapping a book should show that particular book's details screen.

### Requirements:

- Each screen should have a way to refresh content.
- Application must support at least three latest iOS/Android major versions.
- Errors should be handled and information should be shown to the user.

### Wireframes:

### APIs:

- Books: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/KeskoSenukaiDigital/assignment/books
- Book details: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/KeskoSenukaiDigital/assignment/book/{book_id}
- Lists: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/KeskoSenukaiDigital/assignment/lists

### Bonus tasks:

- Store data in database and refresh from API.
- Cover code with unit tests.

### Notes:

- Standard iOS/Android UI components used within Apple Human Interface/Material Design Guidelines is
  enough.
- Code structure and user experience is more important than visuals.
- Prioritize platform's native frameworks against third party options.

Put your app to the public Github repository and share the link with us.
